I wanted to update you regarding my health. Since yesterday afternoon, I have been running a persistent fever which has not broken despite medication. I was admitted to the hospital today, where I was given IV paracetamol, but the fever has continued to return. The doctors have advised that I will likely need to be admitted for further treatment.

I also wanted to let you know that I havenâ€™t received any onboarding mail from the organization yet. Given my current condition, I feel it would be best for me to return home, as I do not have anyone here in Chennai to take care of me during a hospital stay.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will keep you updated about my condition and next steps.

Thank you for your understanding.
